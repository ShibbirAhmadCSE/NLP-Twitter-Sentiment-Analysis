# NLP-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

In this project, I build trained ML models using naive bayes, support vector machine (svm) and logistic regression classifers. The dataset is categorized by three categories: positive (1), neutral (0) and negative(-1). 
The trained models got decent accuracy on the test data.
